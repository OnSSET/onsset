Online interfaces & Applications
====================================

For those who would like to just take a taste of an OnSSET electrification analysis, KTH dESA has collaborated with international organizations in order to develop interactive platforms that allow a quick display of "pre-cooked" electrification results for a number of countries.

Global Electrification Platform
*******************

The `Global Electrification Platform (GEP) <https://electrifynow.energydata.info/>`_ is an open access, interactive, online platform that allows for overview of electrification investment scenarios for 58 countries around the globe. Developed by the World Bank, Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology and partners the GEP provides both visualization of interactive scenarios, data and a customized code version for replicability and updates.

United Nations app
*******************

The `online interface Universal Electrification Access <https://un-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-presentation/>`_ is part of the modelling tools for sustainable development and is based on OnSSET. This interface is not a model but it provides the user easy access to the methodology behind OnSSET, the datasets used and key results -with regards to electrification planning - obtained for a set of 30 scenarios and model runs for 54 developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

Congo Epela Platform
****************

The `Congo Epela platform <https://congoepela.resourcematters.org/en>`_ developed by Resource Matters and partners, shows the dynamic of an OnSSET based electrification analysis. The tool considers a variety of open, geospatial data to determine the least-cost options for bringing electricity in the DRC.
