**[Q] What prior knowledge is required for someone to use OnSSET?**

[A] One should be familiar with the basic principles of energy planning and energy economics.
Experience in working with Geographic Information Systems is also essential in order to build,
analyse and visualize spatial datasets. Python skills are necessary if one would like to modify the code.
New users can learn to use the OnSSET tool using the freely available `online course <https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=11533>`_ (no previous programming or GIS experience required).

**[Q] How long does it take to complete an OnSSET electrification analysis for one country?**

[A] This depends on the compuuter, size of the country, on the resolution of the analysis,
on the country specific characteristics of the grid infrastructure and on the electricity
consumption level scenarios. Most countries are run in a matter of minutes on a regular laptop, although some of the
largest countries may take one or a few hours.

**[Q] What type of renewable sources are used in an OnSSET model? Is it possible to add other sources (biomass etc.)?**

[A] Currently, solar photovoltaics, wind turbines and mini and small hydropower plants are considered
as off grid renewable energy technologies.
The inclusion of bioenergy and hybrid technologies constitutes an ongoing addition.
