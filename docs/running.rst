Running the analysis
====================================

Creating and running a least-cost electrification scenario involves several steps from start to finish.
This section outlines the key steps of an OnSSET analysis, followed by more detailed descriptions of each step in the next sections.

1. **Install the neccessary Python/Anaconda packages and GIS software.**

2. **Collect the neccessary geospatial data.**

3. **Extract the GIS-data to a csv-file**

4. **Calibrate the start year population and electrification status**

5. **Run a least-cost electrification scenario**

6. **Analyze and visualize the results**
