# OnSSET

KTH-dESA researchers are developing an innovative Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit. OnSSET is an open source, spatial electrification tool estimating, analyzing and visualizing the most cost effective electrification option (grid, mini grid & stand-alone) for the achievement of electricity access goals. The tool is focused on the assessment and deployment of conventional and renewable energy technologies aiming at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7). OnSSET, is a tool, designed to ﬁll the gap between the analytical toolbox available to the energy research community and energy planners throughout the world. The tool was already applied to Nigeria, Ethiopia and India, featuring in the World Energy Outlook 2014 and 2015. Future development includes the application of ONSSET to new countries (Kenya, Bolivia, Zimbabwe) as well as training material on the tool.
